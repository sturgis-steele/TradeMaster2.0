    Registry for TradeMaster tools.
    
    This class implements the registry pattern to manage all available tools in the
    TradeMaster system. It provides methods to register new tools, retrieve tools
    by name, list all available tools, and clear the registry.
    
    The registry ensures that:
    1. Each tool has a unique name to prevent conflicts
    2. Tools can be easily accessed by their name
    3. The system can discover all available tools
    4. Tools can be dynamically added or removed
    
    This centralized approach simplifies tool management and allows the LLM engine
    to access tools without needing to know how they're instantiated.
