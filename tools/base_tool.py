    Abstract base class for all TradeMaster tools.
    
    This class defines the interface that all tools must implement. It provides
    the structure for tool identification, parameter definition, and execution.
    
    All tools in the TradeMaster system inherit from this class and must implement
    its abstract methods to ensure consistent behavior across the system.
    
    The tool system allows the LLM to access external data sources and APIs
